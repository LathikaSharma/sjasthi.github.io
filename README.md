## Welcome to Jasthi's GitHub Home Page

I work as Software Consultant at Siemens PLM Software. And I teach Computer Science classes as Community Faculty at Metropolitan State University, MN. The projects hosted on this site are primarily the projects done in different classes I teach. Many of these projects are done for non-profit organizations based in Twin Cities. Majority of the projects span multiple semesters.
